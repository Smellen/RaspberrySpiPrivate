Raspberry Spi
=============

Raspberry Spi is my final year project.

It's a web based application that is hosted on a Raspberry Pi. It uses an integrated camera module capable of taking images and streaming video. The OpenCV library is used when processing both video and images. It is designed to be set up on a home network which can then be accessed through an external IP.
